# Cyclistic bike share analysis
Google Data Analytics Certificate Capstone Project

*The purpose of this case study is to figure out a way to turn casual riders into members.*

Scenario:  You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. Use Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends in order to answer the business task: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 

*Tools used: R for analyis, visualizations and R markdown for report*
